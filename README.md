Experience Cloud provides several standard CMS-related components focused on collections and other manually-curated pieces of content. These custom components complement those standard components and allow you to place relevant and dynamically-selected CMS content on topic detail and record detail pages. This can be used to inform customers and partners, drive context-specific calls to action,and to make your users much happier with the digital experience you create.
